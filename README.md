# pRCA_demo
 This is a minimal working example of the python functions I use for compute pRCA, and which are available in https://github.com/crisjf/binet/
 
Instructions:
-------------
**Open the .ipynb file and see how to fetch data from UN COMTRADE and compute pRCA in a few lines.**

You will need to use Jupyter notebook for working with .ipynb files.

You need to install the binet package from the repository linked above.

Does it work for you? feedback is welcome!
